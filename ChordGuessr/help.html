    <h2>Easy mode</h2>
    <p>For this mode, you only have to guess from one of two types of chords; Major (sounds happy/hopeful) and Minor (sad/dark)</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Medium mode</h2>
    <p>You now have three types of chords to guess from; Major, Minor and Diminished. A diminished chord sounds tense, spooky or unstable.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Advanced mode</h2>
    <p>Advanced mode has the same three chords from medium. However, you also need to guess the root note of the chord. For example: C major, where C is the root note.</p>
